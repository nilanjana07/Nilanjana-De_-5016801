Week 1-Digital Nurture
This module introduces us to essential design principles and patterns that are crucial for 
creating robust and maintainable software. Learners will delve into the SOLID principles, which 
include SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP. They will also explore common design patterns, such as 
Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, which provide reusable solutions to common design 
challenges. The module combines theoretical insights with practical exercises, helping learners 
understand and apply these concepts in their projects, ultimately enhancing their ability to write 
clean, efficient, and scalable code.
